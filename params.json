Also, it is useful creating a sub-document of a large document such a summarization, key points report etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\n\r\nTo create a model for identifying the best possible sequence of Contextual Independent(CI) and Contextually Dependent(CD) sentences in a test document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nA sentence is produced to complete a local discourse and a document can be viewed as a sequence of local discourse units than sentences. Each local discourse unit is a sequence of Contextually independent(CI) sentence followed by contextually dependent(CD) sentences. eg: Scientists A and B discovered twin stars near the black hole in Andromeda galaxy. Also the life span of the black hole is determined by these scientists. An annotated dataset of around 100 documents in which each sentence is annotated as CI/CD will be given.Students has to use a sequence labeling scheme and create a model for identifying the best possible sequence of CI and CD sentences in a test document. The probability of each sentence ton CI can be a measure to represents it's contextual independence.Local Discourse Unit can be utilized as a better linguistic unit with more topic information than a sentence as far as automated text summarization is concerned. Contextual independence of a sentence can play a vital role in deciding it's\r\ngenerality.\r\n\r\nAlgorithms and Tools to be used:\r\nThe algorithms and the tools to be used for implementing the model to identify the\r\ncontextual independence of a sentence in a corpus are as follows:\r\nSequence Labeling Algorithm:\r\nSequence labeling algorithm will be used for part of speech tagging task. Every\r\nsentence will be assigned to a part of speech tag. Sequence labeling can be treated as\r\na set of independent classification tasks, one per member of the sequence. The\r\naccuracy is generally improved by making the optimal label for a given element\r\ndependent on the choices of nearby elements, using special algorithms to choose the\r\nglobally best set of labels for the entire sequence at once.\r\nFor implementing this algorithm we will be using conditional random field (CRF), a\r\npopular probabilistic method for structured prediction.\r\nCRF++ Tool:\r\nCRF++ will be used for conditional random field method implementation. This tool\r\nwill help finding most likely label sequence given an input sequence and\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n",
