        <p>Derived a method to measure the Contextual Independence of a sentence.</p>

<p>Application:</p>

<p>The contextually independent sentences can be used as a general sentence in a different document as they are independent of the context. Also, it is useful creating a sub-document of a large document such a summarization, key points report etc.</p>

<p>Objective:</p>

<p>To create a model for identifying the best possible sequence of Contextual Independent(CI) and Contextually Dependent(CD) sentences in a test document.</p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>A sentence is produced to complete a local discourse and a document can be viewed as a sequence of local discourse units than sentences. Each local discourse unit is a sequence of Contextually independent(CI) sentence followed by contextually dependent(CD) sentences. eg: Scientists A and B discovered twin stars near the black hole in Andromeda galaxy. Also the life span of the black hole is determined by these scientists. An annotated dataset of around 100 documents in which each sentence is annotated as CI/CD will be given.Students has to use a sequence labeling scheme and create a model for identifying the best possible sequence of CI and CD sentences in a test document. The probability of each sentence ton CI can be a measure to represents it's contextual independence.Local Discourse Unit can be utilized as a better linguistic unit with more topic information than a sentence as far as automated text summarization is concerned. Contextual independence of a sentence can play a vital role in deciding it's
generality.</p>

<p>Algorithms and Tools to be used:
The algorithms and the tools to be used for implementing the model to identify the
contextual independence of a sentence in a corpus are as follows:
Sequence Labeling Algorithm:
Sequence labeling algorithm will be used for part of speech tagging task. Every
sentence will be assigned to a part of speech tag. Sequence labeling can be treated as
a set of independent classification tasks, one per member of the sequence. The
accuracy is generally improved by making the optimal label for a given element
dependent on the choices of nearby elements, using special algorithms to choose the
globally best set of labels for the entire sequence at once.
For implementing this algorithm we will be using conditional random field (CRF), a
popular probabilistic method for structured prediction.
CRF++ Tool:
CRF++ will be used for conditional random field method implementation. This tool
will help finding most likely label sequence given an input sequence and
learning.</p>
